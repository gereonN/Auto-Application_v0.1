# **GitHub Setup and Repository Management**

## **Introduction**

This document provides a comprehensive guide to setting up and managing the GitHub repository for the **Automated Job Application Workflow** project. It covers the repository structure, essential tools, GitHub Pages deployment, and integration with automation services such as Make.com.

## **1. Role of GitHub in the Workflow**

GitHub plays a central role in managing the **Automated Job Application Workflow** by serving as the version control system, collaboration platform, and deployment environment. This section outlines the complete **GitHub setup**, including repository structure, branch management, and integration with development tools.

### **Key GitHub Functions in the Workflow:**

✅ **Version Control:** Ensuring changes to scripts, documentation, and automation workflows are tracked.
✅ **Branching & Merging:** Parallel development using feature branches.
✅ **GitHub Pages Deployment:** Hosting documentation and visualizations.
✅ **Integration with Make.com & API Services:** Connecting Make.com workflows with repository updates.
✅ **Collaboration & Review:** Enabling seamless teamwork via pull requests and issues.

## **2. Repository Setup and Structure**

The repository for this project is structured to facilitate scalability and maintainability.

### **GitHub Repository:** [Auto-Application\_v0.1](https://github.com/gereonN/Auto-Application_v0.1)

### **Folder Structure:**

```
📦 Auto-Application_v0.1
 ┣ 📂 docs                 # Project documentation
 ┃ ┣ 📜 research_paper.md  # Main documentation
 ┃ ┣ 📜 mermaid_diagram.md # Workflow visualization
 ┃ ┗ 📜 README.md         # Project overview
 ┣ 📂 automation           # Scripts for job search & AI processing
 ┣ 📂 configs              # Configuration files
 ┣ 📂 models               # Process and architecture models
 ┣ 📂 workflows            # Make.com API workflow integration
 ┗ 📜 LICENSE              # Licensing information
```

This structure ensures that **documentation, automation scripts, and workflow files** remain well-organized and accessible.

## **3. GitHub Setup: Tools & Extensions**

Several extensions and tools have been integrated to enhance GitHub usage within the project:

### **🔹 1️⃣ Visual Studio Code (VS Code) Integration**

- **Installation:** `brew install --cask visual-studio-code`
- **Key Features:**
  ✔ GitHub integration with built-in commit, push, and pull operations.
  ✔ Markdown live preview for documentation (`CMD + Shift + V`).
  ✔ Extensions: `Markdown Preview Mermaid Support`, `GitLens`.

🔗 **Download VS Code:** [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

---

### **🔹 2️⃣ GitKraken for Git Management**

- **Installation:** `brew install --cask gitkraken`
- **Key Features:**
  ✔ Visual representation of commit history and branches.
  ✔ Easy branch switching, merging, and rebasing.
  ✔ One-click GitHub repository integration.
  ✔ Auto-fetching to keep the repository up-to-date.

🔗 **Download GitKraken:** [https://www.gitkraken.com/download](https://www.gitkraken.com/download)

---

### **🔹 3️⃣ Automating Git Operations**

Git automation is enabled via **fetching and auto-prune settings**:

- **Auto-Fetch Interval:** 1 minute (keeps repository updated with remote changes)
- **Auto-Prune Enabled:** Removes obsolete remote branches automatically.
- **Push After Every Commit:** Configurable via GitKraken settings.

## **4. Branching Strategy & Workflow**

Branches are used to separate different areas of development while maintaining a stable `main` branch.

### **📌 Branch Naming Convention**

| Branch Type     | Naming Convention    | Purpose                                       |
| --------------- | -------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Main Branch     | `main`               | Stable production-ready code                  |
| Feature Branch  | `feature-xyz`        | New feature development                       |
| Bugfix Branch   | `fix-bug123`         | Bug fixes & patches                           |
| Workflow Branch | `main_workflow_MAKE` | Make.com integration & automation development |

### **📌 Creating a New Branch in GitKraken**

1️⃣ Click on **Branch → Create Branch**.
2️⃣ Name the branch (e.g., `feature-automated-apply`).
3️⃣ Select the base branch (`main`).
4️⃣ Click **Create** to confirm.

---

## **5. GitHub Pages for Documentation & Visuals**

GitHub Pages is used to host **workflow diagrams & documentation**. The HTML-based **Mermaid.js diagram** and project documentation are published via Pages.

### **📌 Enabling GitHub Pages**

1️⃣ Go to **Repository Settings → Pages**.
2️⃣ Set the source to `main` and directory to `/docs`.
3️⃣ GitHub will deploy the content as a static website.

## **6. Automating GitHub Workflows**

**GitHub Actions** can be used for automation, including:
✔ Auto-updating documentation on new commits.
✔ Running tests and linting scripts before merges.
✔ Automating releases and deployments.

Example **GitHub Actions Workflow (****`.github/workflows/main.yml`****)**:

```yaml
name: CI Pipeline
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Install Dependencies
      run: npm install
    - name: Run Tests
      run: npm test
```
